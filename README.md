## Yo👋

I enjoy spending my free time modding and hacking consoles, exploring emulation and coding. Outside of that stuff, I also spend my time watching sports and listening to music. You can look at my stars to see everything I'm involved in. I'm also on other platforms, so check me out on those if you'd like!
